What most of the people do:
    Limited Exploration
        - dont do EDA
        - just follow the template and plot some fancy graph
        - dont tell the stoey and use thouse inside from the plot
        - then they quicly do model.fit and the model.predict
    Basic Model Training
        - after EDA they just split data fit it and predict it
        - there main focus is to increase the accuracy or lower the error, thats it
        - these models will not perform well 
            - continuosuly the model should maintain that accuracy/error then only we can call it a good model
    Lack of Iteration
        - Afer model is created, they dont revist there model or improve it based on the insights
        - dont validate the assumptions
        - dont handle model violations


Our Coprehensive Approach (we will follow that):
    Thorough Data Research
        - We will deeply look into the date and find the insights
        - We will perform deep ED (not just some fancy graphs)
        - Will build a story line
    Structure Data Procesing
        - Implementing the finding from EDA in the preprocessing stage
        - Ensuring the data is clean and feature-engineered to maximize model performance
        - Continuosuly validation and correcting assumptions during model Training 
        - Fixing any violation through interactive improvement
    Beyond Core ML 
        - Don't just train the model, ensure it meets all the necessary assumptions and refine it iteratively
        - Focus on building robus pipeline that can be reproduced and deployed (MLOps intregration)
    MLOps and Production Readiness
        - Differentiate the project by integrating MLOps pactices using ZenML and MLflow
        - Implement CI/CD pipeline to automate testing of model in production
        - Ensure MODEL is not only accurate but..
            - maintainable
            - scalable
            - ready for real-world use
    Make it readable, reproducible and easy to maintain

Loading the data
    - Use design pattern to handle other sets of data accordingly 
    - make it readable, reproducible and easy to maintain
    - other data set (if we change th data) it should be easy to do

    - try to auomate the preproces
    - try to use different types of classes

EDA
    - julius.ai - very useful it also have workflow (template)
    - use this for EDA
